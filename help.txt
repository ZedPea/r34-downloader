rule34-paheal-downloader

A program to download all the images of a given tag from https://rule34.paheal.net

To use, place the program in the folder which you wish to download images to, and invoke the program.

If you don't provide any command line arguments the program will then prompt you for a tag to download from.

Unfortunately the website only lets us make a request once a second so that's the reason you aren't maxing out your bandwidth.

The program does support async IO, so a slow network connection will not effect the speed as much, we send a request roughly every second.

Flags:


-t / --tag

Specify a tag to download on the command line. You must use underscores instead of spaces.

Usage: ./r34downloader --tag "cute_anime_girl"

This will download all images with the tag cute_anime_girl.


-f / --first

Specify the amount of images to download. Input should be a positive number.

Usage: ./r34download --t "cute_anime_girl" --first 10

This will download the first 10 images from the tag cute_anime_girl, if it exists.


-h / --help

Prints a help message.

Usage: ./r34download --help

Outputs this help message.


-d / --directory

Lets you select the directory to download the images to. The directory must exist. If the directory does not exist, the program will fall back to the current working directory.

Usage: ./r34downloader --t "cute_anime_girl" --directory "/media/Pictures"

This will download all images with the tag cute_anime_girl to the directory /media/Pictures, if it exists.


-s / --search

Lets you search for a tag if you don't know if it exists/the full name.

Usage: `./r34downloader --search "cute"

If a tag "cute_anime_girl" existed, it would be printed to the console, along with any other tags beginning with "cute".
Tag search is not case sensitive, so "cute", would also find tags beginning with "Cute", for example.
